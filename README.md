# frePPLe

## Open source supply chain planning

FrePPLe is an easy-to-use and easy-to-implement open source **advanced planning and scheduling** tool for manufacturing companies.

When spreadsheets doesn't suffice any longer to adequately plan and schedule your production, frePPLe allows an easy and cost-efficient way to generate a more optimized plan.

FrePPLe implements planning algoritms based on best practices such as **theory of constraints** (ie *plan around the bottleneck*), **pull-based planning** (ie *start production as late as possible and directly triggered by demand*) and **lean manufacturing** (ie *avoid intermediate delays and inventory*).
