Resources
=========

Resources represent capacity. They represent a machine, a group of machines,
an operator, a group of operators, or some logical capacity constraint.

`Operations <operations>`_ will consume capacity using `operation resources <operation-resources>`_.

Different types of resources exist:

* | `Default <#default-resource>`_:
  | A default resource is constrained with a maximum load size. The resource
    size defines how many operations that can use the resource in parallel.
    
  E.g. A resource that can run 1 job at a time.

* | `Time buckets <#time-buckets-resource>`_:
  | A bucketized resource is constrained by the amount of resource-hours per
    time bucket. The detailed scheduling of the resource within this bucket
    isn't considered.
    
  E.g. A resource that has 40 hours available per week.

* | `Quantity buckets <#quantity-buckets-resource>`_:
  | A bucketized resource is constrained with a maximum load quantity per
    time bucket.
  
  E.g. A resource that can produce 1000 units per week.

* | `Infinite resource <#infinite-resource>`_:
  | An infinite resource has no capacity limit.

==================== ================= ===========================================================

Default resource
----------------

A default resource is constrained with a maximum load size. The resource size
defines how many operations that can use the resource in parallel.

For detailed planning and scheduling this is the most suitable resource type.
E.g. A resource that can run 2 jobs at the same time.

No fields are defined in addition to the ones listed above.

Time buckets resource
---------------------

A resource of this type is constrained by the amount of resource-hours
per time bucket. E.g. A resource that has 40 hours available per week.

The available time per capacity bucket is computed using:

* its size, as specified by the maximum or the maximum_calendar field.

* its working hours, as specfied by its available calendar field and its
  location's available calendar field

A manufacturing order will consume the required capacity in the capacity
bucket where it starts.

For master planning and rough cut capacity planning this is most suitable
resource type. Detailed scheduling of the operations within the time
bucket isn't considered useful in this type of plan.

Quantity buckets resource
-------------------------

A resource of this type is constrained by a maximum quantity per time
bucket. E.g. A resource that can produce 1000 units per week

For master planning and rough cut capacity planning this is most suitable
resource type. Detailed scheduling of the operations within the time
bucket isn't considered useful.

The maximum_calendar field defines the time buckets, as well as the
available quantity per time bucket.

A number of specialized operationresource subclasses exist to select 
in which bucket the capacity needs to be consumed: at the start of the
operationplan, at the end of the operationplan or somewhere between
the start and end.

Infinite resource
-----------------

An infinite resource has no capacity limit. It is useful to monitor the
loading or usage of a resource without constraining the plan.

The fields 'maximum' and 'maximum_calendar' are unused for this resource type.
